# System Modeling and Design

NOTE⚠️: _Modeling serves as the roadmap for a software system. It allows developers to visualize the architecture, identify potential issues early, and ensure that the system meets the business requirements. By focusing on modeling, we avoid common pitfalls, where poorly structured code leads to impasses._

In this section, we translate [the business components](./overview.md#system-business-components) into documented actors, use cases, and diagrams.

## Actors

- Customer
- Sales Agent
- Administrator
- Receptionist
- Service Manager
- Service Staff
- Supplier Vendor
- Payment Gateway
- Garage Manager
- Policy Manager
